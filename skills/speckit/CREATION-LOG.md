# Speckit Skills Migration - Creation Log

## Context

Converted speckit agents to standard CLI skills format to improve discoverability, documentation, and integration with existing CLI skills.

## Migration Date

2026-01-16

## Source Files

The speckit workflow was previously implemented as custom agents and has been converted to the standard CLI skills format for better integration and discoverability.

## Created Skills

### Main Orchestrator
- `.github/skills/speckit/SKILL.md` - Complete workflow documentation

### Core Workflow Skills
- `.github/skills/speckit-specify/SKILL.md` - Specification creation
- `.github/skills/speckit-plan/SKILL.md` - Technical planning
- `.github/skills/speckit-tasks/SKILL.md` - Task generation

### Supporting Skills
- `.github/skills/speckit-checklist/SKILL.md` - Quality validation
- `.github/skills/speckit-constitution/SKILL.md` - Principles management

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Workflow Restructuring

**Before:**
```
specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → implement
```

**After:**
```
brainstorming → specify → plan → tasks → (executing-plans OR test-driven-development)
```

**Rationale:**
- `brainstorming` skill provides better requirements exploration than clarify
- `speckit.analyze` was redundant with checklist validation
- `speckit.implement` functionality better served by existing `executing-plans` and `test-driven-development` skills
- Gives users choice of implementation approach (sequential vs TDD)

### 2. Main Workflow Skill

Created `speckit` as main orchestrator that:
- Documents complete workflow from brainstorming to implementation
- References all other speckit skills
- Provides quick start guide
- Defines iron laws and anti-patterns
- Shows workflow entry points for different scenarios

**Rationale:**
- Users need single source of truth for complete workflow
- Matches pattern of systematic-debugging (comprehensive documentation)
- Enables discovery ("what is speckit?")

### 3. Skill Format

Each skill follows structure:
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description
---

# Title

## Purpose
## Prerequisites
## What This Skill Does
## Key Principles
## Execution Flow
## Success Indicators
## Output
## Common Mistakes
## Related Skills
```

**Rationale:**
- Consistent with systematic-debugging skill
- Self-documenting and discoverable
- Clear prerequisites prevent misuse
- Success indicators help validation
- Related skills enable workflow navigation

### 4. Preserved Original Execution Logic

**Decision:** Skills are now self-contained with complete execution logic

**Rationale:**
- Skills should be standalone and not depend on external agent files
- All necessary execution logic incorporated into skill documentation
- Cleaner architecture without external dependencies
- Users only need to reference the skill, not hunt for implementation details

### 5. Integration with Existing Skills

**Integrated Skills:**
- `brainstorming` - Required first step (replaces clarify/analyze)
- `executing-plans` - Implementation option A
- `test-driven-development` - Implementation option B
- `systematic-debugging` - Reference for debugging during implementation
- `verification-before-completion` - Reference for validation

**Rationale:**
- Leverage existing, proven skills rather than duplicate
- Create cohesive skill ecosystem
- Users benefit from skill improvements across workflow

## Migration Approach

### Phase 1: Create Skills ✅
- Created all 6 skill directories
- Wrote comprehensive SKILL.md for each
- Documented workflow, principles, examples

### Phase 2: Documentation (Next)
- [ ] Create CREATION-LOG.md for each skill
- [ ] Update copilot-instructions.md to reference new skills
- [ ] Add migration notice to old agent files

### Phase 3: Validation (Next)
- [ ] Test each skill in isolation
- [ ] Test complete workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify agent file execution still works
- [ ] Update any broken references

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Future)
- [ ] Deprecate old agent files (after validation)
- [ ] Update any external documentation
- [ ] Announce migration to users

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Discoverability:** Skills appear in CLI skill list, users can find workflow easily
2. **Documentation:** Each skill self-documents purpose, prerequisites, success criteria
3. **Workflow Clarity:** Main `speckit` skill provides complete workflow overview
4. **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing skills (brainstorming, executing-plans, TDD)
5. **Flexibility:** Users can invoke individual skills or follow full workflow
6. **Consistency:** Follows established CLI skill patterns

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Workflow Dependencies
**Problem:** Skills have dependencies (specify requires brainstorming, plan requires specify)
**Solution:** Prerequisites section clearly documents dependencies, main skill shows complete workflow

### Challenge 2: Detailed Execution Logic
**Problem:** Agent files contain detailed bash scripts and validation logic
**Solution:** Skills reference agent files for detailed steps, focus on principles and patterns

### Challenge 3: Multiple Entry Points
**Problem:** Users might start at different workflow stages
**Solution:** Main skill documents all entry points (new feature, existing spec, existing plan, quality check)

### Challenge 4: Implementation Choice
**Problem:** `speckit.implement` was monolithic, users wanted TDD option
**Solution:** Offer explicit choice between `executing-plans` (sequential) and `test-driven-development` (TDD)

## Testing Plan

### Unit Testing (Per Skill)
- [ ] Test `speckit-specify` creates spec.md with correct structure
- [ ] Test `speckit-plan` generates all artifacts (plan, data-model, contracts, research, quickstart)
- [ ] Test `speckit-tasks` creates tasks.md with correct format and organization
- [ ] Test `speckit-checklist` generates quality validation checklists
- [ ] Test `speckit-constitution` creates/updates constitution correctly

### Integration Testing (Complete Workflow)
- [ ] Test full workflow: brainstorming → specify → plan → tasks → executing-plans
- [ ] Test full workflow: brainstorming → specify → plan → tasks → test-driven-development
- [ ] Test partial workflow: specify → plan → tasks (skip brainstorming)
- [ ] Test constitution enforcement throughout workflow
- [ ] Test checklist validation at appropriate stages

### Regression Testing
- [ ] Verify original agent files still work
- [ ] Verify existing specs/plans/tasks still valid
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes to file formats

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. **copilot-instructions.md:**
   - Add section on speckit skills
   - Update workflow documentation
   - Reference new skill names

2. **README.md (if exists):**
   - Document speckit workflow
   - Link to skill files
   - Provide quick start example

3. **Migration Notice:**
   - Add to old agent files
   - Point users to new skills
   - Explain benefits of migration

## Backward Compatibility

**Strategy:** Maintain both formats during transition
- Original agent files preserved in `.github/agents/`
- New skills in `.github/skills/`
- Skills reference agent files for detailed execution
- Allows gradual migration and validation

**Timeline:**
- **Now:** Both coexist, users can use either
- **After validation:** Recommend skills, soft deprecate agents
- **Future:** Remove agent files once skills proven

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation First:** Writing comprehensive skill documentation revealed workflow gaps
2. **User Choice Matters:** Offering implementation options (executing-plans vs TDD) increases adoption
3. **Integration Over Duplication:** Leveraging existing skills better than reimplementation
4. **Clear Dependencies:** Explicit prerequisites prevent workflow confusion
5. **Workflow Overview:** Main orchestrator skill essential for complex multi-step workflows

## Future Enhancements

1. **Workflow Automation:** Script to run complete workflow with prompts
2. **Validation Tools:** Automated checklist validation during workflow
3. **Templates:** More domain-specific templates (mobile apps, APIs, data pipelines)
4. **Examples:** Complete example walkthroughs for common feature types
5. **Metrics:** Track workflow success rates, common failure points

## Conclusion

Successfully migrated speckit agents to skills format, improving discoverability, documentation, and integration while maintaining backward compatibility. New workflow (brainstorming → specify → plan → tasks → implement) provides clearer structure and user choice for implementation approach.
